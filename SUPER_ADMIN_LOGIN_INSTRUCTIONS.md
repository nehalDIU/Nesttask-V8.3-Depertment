# Super Admin Login Instructions

I've fixed the super admin login issue with the following changes:

1. Fixed the super admin credentials in the database
2. Ensured proper role assignment in both auth.users and public.users tables
3. Updated the authentication hook to properly handle super admin login

## How to Log In as Super Admin

Follow these steps to log in as the super admin:

1. **Use these credentials**:
   - **Email**: `superadmin@nesttask.com`
   - **Password**: `SuperAdmin123!`

2. You should be redirected to the Super Admin Dashboard at:
   `C:\Users\Sheikh Shariar Nehal\Desktop\NestTAsk\Depertmment\NestTask-V7.0.5_Depertment_added\src\components\admin\super\SuperAdminDashboard.tsx`

## What Was Fixed

1. **Database Issues**:
   - The super admin credentials were reset and properly configured
   - The role value was standardized to 'super-admin' (with hyphen) everywhere
   - Added additional check to ensure the super admin exists in the public.users table

2. **Authentication Logic**:
   - Updated the useAuth hook to properly handle the super admin role
   - Added special case handling for the super admin login
   - Improved logging for debugging authentication issues

3. **Role Consistency**:
   - Ensured consistent role format across the database and application
   - Verified correct mapping between database and application roles

## Testing

I've included a test script (`test-super-admin-login.js`) that you can run to verify the super admin login:

```bash
node test-super-admin-login.js
```

This script will:
1. Test logging in with the super admin credentials
2. Check the role values in both database tables
3. Verify that everything is properly configured

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter any issues:

1. Check the browser console for any error messages
2. Verify that you're using the exact email and password provided above
3. Clear your browser cache and local storage by:
   - Opening DevTools (F12)
   - Going to Application → Storage → Clear Site Data

The super admin login should now correctly redirect you to the Super Admin Dashboard.
